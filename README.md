# AcronymsWSD
Acronyms  disambiguation  is considered  a  word  sense  disambiguation (WSD) task which consists on determining the correct expansion of an acronym based on a given context. This  paper  describes  three  hybrid  systems  to  disambiguate acronyms in scientific documents, which combine three supervised machine learning (ML) models (Support Vector Machine,  Naive  Bayes  and  K-Nearest Neighbor) with cosine similarity on SciAD corpus. Our system  achieved its  best performance on the independent test set on Naive Bayes and cosine similarity with 92.15% of precision, 77.97% of recalland 84.47% of F1-macro measure.
